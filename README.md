This simple web tool can be used to generate a Certificate Signature Request (CSR) file.  These files are submitted in a TDX ticket to ITS Operations when requesting a new certificate for a server.  It will also generate the private key file associated with the certificate.  The .key file is placed on the server with the certificate (once it is generated) and should be deleted from your local machine as soon as possible.
